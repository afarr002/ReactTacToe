# React Tac Toe ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)

## Description

I wanted practice with React, and I thought what better way than a tutorial from ReactJS.org? Only, I wanted to do it my way! So I built, refactored, and built again the funtionality of their Tic Tac Toe tutorial. I refined my knowledge of passing props, setting state, and the basics of the React library!

## Installation

In your CLI, run

```
npm run start
```

and the local server will kick off for your Tic Tac Toe contests.

## Usage

X will always start first, and simply click on a square to mark it. X and O will switch turns until one player achieves three squares in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) or all nine squares are filled, which results in a draw. You can also go "back in time" with dynamically generated buttons for each move. Simply click a button to revisit the past and fix your mistakes!
